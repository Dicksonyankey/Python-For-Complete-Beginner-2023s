Congratulations!! You have sucessfully installed python onto your MAC or PC.

**NOTE** 

These arrows `>>>` you see with the cursor im front means you are in the python interactive shell and it can be equally used to write python code and also as a calculator. The interactive shell mode is simply input and output operations. you give it an input and python gives back the corresponding output.



## USING THE INTERACTIVE SHELL FOR BASIC CALCULATIONS

Since the python interactive shell is an input and output flow operations it can be used for basic calculations. let's see some examples to get us started with the interactive shell.

**Next**

Noe click in the file icon and create a new python file eg. `lesson1.py` can be the file name, after that hit enter and the file will be created.

Congratulations now you have vs code instaled and working, and then you have created a new folder and also imported it into the vs code environment and finally you created your first python file.

**HAPPY CODING**
